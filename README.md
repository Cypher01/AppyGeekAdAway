# Appy Geek AdAway
This Xposed Module removes Ads from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobilesrepublic.appygeek">Appy Geek</a> using the <a href="http://repo.xposed.info/">Xposed Framework</a>.

Its current capabilities are limited to removing fullscreen Ads shown when the App is started. Remove list Ads planned, but I can't give an ETA.

The module has been tested on

* Android 4.4.4
  - Xposed v54
* Android 5.0.2
  - Xposed v71
* Android 5.1.1
  - Xposed v72
